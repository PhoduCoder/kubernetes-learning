=====
Command to be switching context 
kubectl config get-contexts 
kubectl config use-context abc 

======
a) Create a pod using a specific image version 
Expose a given port 

Task 1 
A web application requires a specific version of redis to be used as a cache.
Create a pod with the following characteristics, and leave it running when complete:
• The pod must run in the web namespace.
The namespace has already been created
• The name of the pod should be cache
• Use the Ifccncf/redis image with the 3.2 tag
• Expose port 6379

Use imperative commands

kubectl run <name-of-pod> --image=icnf/redis:6.3 --port 6379 -n <name-of-webspace>

Task 2
=====

You are tasked to create a secret and consume the secret in a pod using environment variables as follow:
Task
• Create a secret named another-secret with a key/value pair; key1/value4
• Start an nginx pod named nginx-secret using container image nginx, and add an environment variable
exposing the value of the secret key key 1, using COOL_VARIABLE as the name for the environment
variable inside the pod

kubectl create secret generic some-secret --from-literal=key1=value4

kubectl run mypod --image=nginx:stable -n web-ns 

Now create a manifest and edit it to include the secrets as environment variables 

======

Task 3

You are required to create a pod that requests a certain amount of CPU and memory, so it gets scheduled
to-a node that has those resources available.
• Create a pod named nginx-resources in the pod-resources namespace that requests a minimum of
200m CPU and 1Gi memory for its container
• The pod should use the nginx image
• The pod-resources namespace has already been created

requests and limits 

=====

Task 4 

You are tasked to create a ConfigMap and consume the ConfigMap in a pod using a volume mount.
Task
Please complete the following:
• Create a ConfigMap named another-config containing the key/value pair: key4/value3
• start a pod named nginx-configmap containing a single container using the
nginx image, and mount the key you just created into the pod under directory /also/a/path

Again use imperative command 

kubectl create cm test-config --from-literal=key5=value7

====

Task 5 

Context
Your application’s namespace requires a specific service account to be used.
Task
Update the app-a deployment in the production namespace to run as the restrictedservice service
account. The service account has already been created.

=====

Multi container pods 

Create a Pod with three busy box containers with commands “ls; sleep 3600;”,
 “echo Hello World; sleep 3600;” and “echo this is the third container; sleep 3600” respectively and check the status

kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --restart=Never --dry-run -o yaml -- bin/sh -c "sleep 3600; ls" > multi-container.yaml

To edit a command 

Create a Pod with main container busybox and which executes this “while true; do echo ‘Hi I am from Main container’ >> /var/log/index.html;
 sleep 5; done” and with sidecar container with nginx image which exposes on port 80. Use emptyDir Volume and mount this volume on path /var/log for busybox and on path /usr/share/nginx/html for nginx container. Verify both containers are running.
