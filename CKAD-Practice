#Imperative command to run a pod
#Create a pod
kubectl run <name-of-pod> --image=nginx:latest

#Delete a pod without waiting
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --force

#create pod and also expose a port
kubectl run <my-pod-name> --image=nginx --port 80 

#Create busybox pod with a command "echo hello world"
kubectl run mypod --image=busybox --command -- /bin/sh -c "echo hello world"

#Describe pods with various verbosity 
kubectl get pod mypod -v=7
# Helps you get other details of what's happening behind the scenes.
kubectl get pod mypod -v=8
kubectl get pod mypod -v=9

#Creation of pods with a given set of labels
kubectl run mypod --image=nginx -labels="env=test,app=myapp"

#To query the pods with the labels
#For a single label, -l works
kubectl get pods -l "app=myapp"
The above command lists the pod, but when i specify both the labels
in the -l option, then it fails.

#For the above scenario, use --selector
kubectl get pods --selector "app=myapp,env=prod"

#Creation of multipod containers
#Create three busybox with various commands executed in each of them

#This will have to be created using a manifest
# We create the initial manifest using the --dry-run 
# and -o yaml option in our first command
# direct the output to a file and then
# edit the file contents to have more containers
# in it. 

#Keep in mind that --dry-run option has to be specified
# before the command option'

kubectl run multicont --dry-run -o yaml --command -- /bin/sh -c "ls; sleep 3600" > multi.yaml

Then add two more containers in the manifest
