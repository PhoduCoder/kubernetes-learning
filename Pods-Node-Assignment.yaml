Assigning Pods to nodes

How do we ensure that pods are assigned to a specific node?
There are many scenarios where this will be useful.
Eg. Assigning a pod to a GPU enabled node
Or assigning a windows pod to a windows node, assuming that 
your cluster has both windows and linux nodes
====
One way to do so is to use NodeSelector.
Here you will label the node with a determined key value pair

Then when creating the pod spec, you will add a NodeSelector section
in the containers spec and provide the labels

=====
We labelled the minikube node with the env=test label
kubectl label node minikube {env=test,app=testapp}

Now we will have the pod spec look like below
======
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: test
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  nodeSelector:
    env: prod
=====
You will see that the pod will always be in a pending state
This is because it is looking for a node which has been 
marked with the label env=prod
====
So to fix this, we can adopt one of the two ways
1. let's change the pod spec
with the nodeSelector with env as test
OR 
2. We can label the minikube node with env=prod
using the below command
kubectl label node minikube --overwrite env=prod
====
The second way is to specify nodeName in the spec of the pod

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  nodeName: minikube
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: test
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  #nodeSelector:
    #env: prod

===
This is not a great way, since this won't scale in the best way
Better is to label the node and then use nodeSelector in the pod spec
=====

Other options are to use
Affinity and Anti-affinity
as well as 
Taints and tolerations.

Will add more to this.
