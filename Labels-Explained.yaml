Labels Explained - Assigning Pods to particular nodes


All objects in kubernetes have labels. This is a way to add key value pairs 
to various kubernetes objects.

One can append the --show-labels to each object 
to list the set of labels already attached.

Eg. To list all pods with their applied labels

#####
Gauravs-MBP:K8s alieninvader$ kubectl get pods --show-labels
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    LABELS
mypod                         2/2     Running   0          22m    <none>
php-apache-5b56f9df94-r74qk   1/1     Running   0          7d3h   pod-template-hash=5b56f9df94,run=php-apache
######

To list all labels applied to nodes
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
Similarly, for svc or apiservices, just add a --show-labels at the end 

==========
Now how do you add a label to an apiresource object. For this , we will use
the below command
kubectl label <object> <object-name> key1=value1

To add multiple labels, we separate the labels by a comma and include them in
paranthesis.

kubectl label pods mypod {app=testapp,dept=bu1}

If --overwrite is true, then existing labels can be overwritten, otherwise attempting to overwrite a label will
result in an error

kubectl label pod mypod --overwrite dept=bu2

=====
Labels Vs Annotations? What is the difference?

Both represent metadata information about the objects.

Labels are metadata assigned to objects for identification purposes.
For instance, a service selects the backend pod using the labels on pods.

Annotations are additional metadata that can be open-ended.
It may be used for documentation purposes, 
or it can be used for configuring an object.


In the backend etcd database,
Labels are indexed in Etcd and can be searched on. 
Annotations can't be searched on
Annotations are not generally used by K8s. 

LABELS are for kubernetes
while annotations are for USERS. 

Labels values have a limit of 63 characters
as opposed to annotations which can be small or large,
structured or unstructured, and can include characters not permitted by labels.
