Try-outs 

Create a service in VPC with --external-IP
set to any ENI on the VPC 

Create a service of type LoadBalancer in EKS
and set spec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts to false
and see if NodePorts creation is avoided

Create a LoadBalancer in EKS 
Annotate it with 
metadata:
      name: my-service
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"

And see what happens with preserving the client IP

Set the .spec.externalTrafficPolicy to Local : This should 
forward the client IP to pods

See what happens when .spec.externalTrafficPolicy is set to Cluster
then the client IP won't be forwarded

===
Try to configure a service using type
ExternalName [ create a public RDS endpoint] [Or a public webserver]
also try to configure a service using
service without selectors and endpoint slices

====
Create a service with priavte RDS endpoint 
Try using the endpoint slices vs externamName
when to use which one?
